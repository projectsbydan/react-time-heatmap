[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/924b2f51-6e9a-4b3b-8cef-4195fffe6302/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-time-heatmap/deploys)

## Show a heatmap based on the time of day for several days

üòé Demo: https://react-time-heatmap.netlify.app/

The component takes time entries and displays the count as a heatmap.

‚úî add entries for an unlimited number of days

‚úî select the number of groups/levels to show in colours

‚úî can be made to flow and use all space it has responsively

## Examples

Shows entries from 7 days of entries (the entries themselves contain data for 7 days or for 168 hours)

```typescript
<TimeHeatMap timeEntries={entries} />
```

Shows entries into a custom number of groups

```typescript
<TimeHeatMap timeEntries={entries} numberOfGroups={7} />
```

Shows count for every hour (use for testing)

```typescript
<TimeHeatMap timeEntries={entries} showCounts={true} />
```

![Entries example](https://react-time-heatmap-img.netlify.app/entries.png)

‚úî hours, minutes or time zone are not relevant

‚úî `time` needs to be a valid date

‚úî the entries will be sorted by the component (left to right, past to present)

üëè typescript will make sure you type everything right

## Examples

## About

- made with React Hooks
- uses CSS Grid to create the arrangement
- styles applied with sass modules
