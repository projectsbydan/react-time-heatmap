## Show a heatmap based on the time of day for a week

üòé Demo: https://react-time-heatmap.netlify.app/

The component takes in time entries and displays the count as a heatmap.

‚úî You can add entries for an unlimited number of days

‚úî Select the number of groups/levels to show in colours

‚úî Can be made to flow, to use all space it has responsively

## Examples

Shows entries from 7 days separated into 4 groups

```typescript
<TimeHeatMap timeEntries={entries} />
```

Shows entries into a custom number of groups

```typescript
<TimeHeatMap timeEntries={entries} numberOfGroups={7} />
```

Shows count for every hour

```typescript
<TimeHeatMap timeEntries={entries} showCounts={true} />
```
